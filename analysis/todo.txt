* For general analysis *

1) reasonable binning to data
2) survival P for each variable &  bin
3) graphs ! plotly?

* spectral *

1) "distance measurements" for each variable based in survival P changes per bins.
2) affinity matrix
3) run sklearn clustering
4) evaluate -> repeat 1-3 until good enough

* Decision Tree *

1) study scikit-learn how to do it

* Neural Network *

1) Keras or PyTorch?
